1. PrjML contains the code and report for training and evaluating a neural network model using 25 variables selected from the dataset.
2. PrjML2 includes the code and report for a hybrid approach combining Neural Network and Elastic Net regression. In this phase, feature selection was performed to remove unrelated variables, and the "kd-cor-el" dataset (the corrected and filtered version of the original dataset) was used.
3. explML presents the exploratory data analysis (EDA) performed on the original KDD dataset, which was used without any modifications to better understand the initial data characteristics.

These projects demonstrate the process of model development from initial exploration, feature selection, to final model refinement and evaluation.
